# ToxAffinity Analysis

This directory contains the full post-docking analysis layer for ToxDock-Bench: manuscript-grade tables and figures for a 16-target toxicity panel across 5 methods.  
It is designed for users who already have merged per-target prediction tables and PoseBusters outputs and need reproducible, publication-ready scoring/ranking/screening/pose-quality analysis.  
What is analyzed here: (i) affinity agreement and rank preservation (Pearson/Spearman/Kendall), (ii) early recognition metrics for actives/inactives (EF/nEF, ROC-AUC, BEDROC), (iii) pose plausibility profiles, and (iv) cross-method inferential statistics with uncertainty and multiplicity correction (bootstrap/permutation, Wilcoxon, BH/Holm).  
Methodological anchors and model context: [Boltz-2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.14.659707), [PoseBusters](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07487-1), [Early-recognition metrics (EF/BEDROC)](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci600426e), [ROC analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2005.10.010), [BH-FDR](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2517-6161.1995.tb02031.x), [Holm correction](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4615733).

  - merged tables: `analysis/tables/merged_ligands_docking_<pdb>.csv`
  - pose checks: `analysis/tables/posebuster/posebusters_results_<pdb>_<method>.csv`
- Output directories:
  - tables: `analysis/tables/*`
  - figures: `analysis/figures/*`
- Help for full CLI:

```bash
python ../src/analysis/run_pipeline.py --help
```

## Output Contract

| File / field | Meaning | Units / scale | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tables/correlations/summary_all_proteins.csv` + `pearson_r`, `spearman_rho`, `kendall_tau` | score-vs-pKi association per target/method | correlation coefficients | scoring/ranking quality |
| `tables/correlations/correlations_with_ci_perm.csv` + `*_ci_low/high`, `*_perm_p` | uncertainty and nonparametric significance | CI bounds, permutation p | robustness of associations |
| `tables/enrichment/ef_summary_all_proteins.csv` + `nEF10_active`, `nEF10_low` | early enrichment for active/inactive compounds | normalized EF in [0,1] | screening triage behavior |
| `tables/posebusters/pass_rates_by_target_method.csv` + `pass_rate_all` | fraction of poses passing all checks | proportion in [0,1] | docking plausibility |
| `tables/inferential/pairwise_method_tests.csv` + `p_holm`, `median_diff_a_minus_b` | cross-target method-vs-method inference | adjusted p + effect | confirmatory global comparisons |
| `tables/inferential/per_target_pairwise_tests.csv` + `perm_p_bh_target`, `effect_obs` | per-target pairwise inference | BH-adjusted p + effect | target-specific method behavior |

Interpretation scope:
- Use correlation outputs for continuous affinity fidelity.
- Use nEF outputs for early retrieval/deprioritization scenarios.
- Use PoseBusters to assess geometric/chemical plausibility of predicted poses.
- Do not use a single metric as a stand-alone quality verdict.

## Reproducibility

- Default seed: `RANDOM_SEED=42`.
- SI profile: `N_BOOTSTRAP=10000`, `N_PERMUTATION=10000` (`pipeline/postprocess/run_si_full.sh`).
- Deterministic components: table aggregation and plotting given fixed inputs and seed.
- Partially stochastic components: bootstrap/permutation statistics (seed-controlled).
- Reproducible out-of-the-box artifacts:
  - all CSV tables in `analysis/tables/`
  - all figure assets in `analysis/figures/` (PNG/SVG).

## Evaluation Status

- Implemented now:
  - scoring/ranking correlations + CI/permutation;
  - screening EF/nEF summaries;
  - PoseBusters pass-rate summaries and per-check heatmaps;
  - cross-target and per-target pairwise inferential tests.
- Planned / evolving:
  - additional endpoint families can be added in `src/analysis/inferential.py`;
  - figure layout/style refinements continue in `src/analysis/plots/`.
- Relevant scripts:
  - pipeline wrappers: `pipeline/postprocess/run_article_analysis.sh`, `pipeline/postprocess/run_si_full.sh`
  - core code: `src/analysis/`
  - postprocess bridge: `pipeline/postprocess/`.

## GitHub release bundle

The repository tracks **`analysis/tables/`** and **`analysis/figures/`** (~111 MB total) as the canonical manuscript/SI analysis bundle. Logs under `analysis/logs/` stay local.

| Path | Contents | Size (approx.) |
|---|---|---|
| `analysis/tables/` | CSV summaries, merged ligand scores, inferential tests, overlap audit | ~20 MB |
| `analysis/figures/` | PNG + SVG for heatmaps, scatters, nEF, PoseBusters, Wilcoxon | ~92 MB |

SI LaTeX PNGs are a **flat copy** of figures from `analysis/figures/`:

```bash
bash manuscript/supplementary/build_si.sh   # copies *.png → manuscript/supplementary/images/
```

To publish on GitHub after updating analysis:

```bash
git add analysis/tables analysis/figures analysis/README.md analysis/config
git status analysis/
git commit -m "Add AffiTox analysis tables and figure bundle for manuscript reproduction."
git push origin main
```

Optional Zenodo zip of the same tree:

```bash
bash pipeline/postprocess/package_zenodo.sh   # creates toxdock-analysis-artifacts.zip
```


| Zenodo link | What it contains | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `https://zenodo.org/records/<ANALYSIS_TABLES_RECORD_ID>` | `analysis/tables/` CSV artifacts (correlations, enrichment, inferential, PoseBusters summaries) | recommended for lightweight reproducibility packs |
| `https://zenodo.org/records/<ANALYSIS_FIGURES_RECORD_ID>` | `analysis/figures/` PNG/SVG manuscript assets | useful for SI/manuscript snapshot distribution |

Replace placeholder record IDs with your published Zenodo links.
